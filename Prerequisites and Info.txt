You need to install the packages/modules:
Tensorflow and keras.

Anaconda install code run:

Tensorflow:
To install the current release of CPU-only TensorFlow, recommended for beginners:
conda create -n tf tensorflow
conda activate tf

Or, to install the current release of GPU TensorFlow on Linux or Windows:
conda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu
conda activate tf-gpu

Keras:
conda install -c conda-forge keras


In this example I built a Convolutional Neural Network model which process and learns from thousands of different images in order to predict if given picture is a A or B (in my case a cat or a dog).

Important Note: as of today GitHub have a limited capacity per repository, so I'm not able to upload the thousands of pictures used in the model; and uploading less pictures will possibly change the outcome, so I encourage you to use your own images and test the given results in your own Convolutional Neural Network model.


R is awesome, but back in the days when I wanted to expand my knowledge from R to Python I took an amazing self taught Machine Learning course called 'ML A-Z'; the course tutors are Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. And as of today I keep doing different projects with the previous knowledge learned.
